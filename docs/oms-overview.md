# Sprint Connect OMS — System Overview

**Version:** 2.0  
**Host:** `https://api.sprintconnect.io/v1`

---

## 1. System Overview

Sprint Connect OMS is an Order Management System that orchestrates outbound customer orders (Delivery, Express, Click & Collect) and inbound warehouse operations (Purchase Orders, Transfer Orders, Returns, Damaged Goods). It operates as a **modular monolith** composed of five bounded contexts, each owning a dedicated MySQL schema.

### 1.1 Bounded Contexts

| Module | Schema | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Order | `orders` | Order lifecycle, state machine, webhooks, outbox, delivery slots |
| Payment | `payment` | Invoices, credit notes, POS recalculations, fees, promotions |
| Returns | `returns` | Customer returns, put-away, refunds |
| Config | `config` | Store locations, business units, rollout policies, routing rules |
| Inbound | `inbound` | Purchase orders, transfer orders, damaged goods |

### 1.2 System Actors

| Actor | Key | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Customer | C | Places and receives orders |
| CFW Gateway | GW | Customer-facing API gateway; forwards customer requests |
| Proxy Service | PS | Internal routing proxy between GW and backend systems |
| Sprint Connect | SC / OMS | This system — order orchestration hub |
| Warehouse System | WMS | Picks, packs, and stores goods |
| Transport System | TMS | Dispatches drivers and tracks deliveries |
| Point of Sale | POS | Calculates prices, applies promotions, issues invoices |
| Settlement Tax System | STS | Issues official ABB/Tax invoices post-PickConfirmed (Prepaid) or post-Delivered (POD) |

### 1.3 Integration Pattern

OMS integrates with external systems using two patterns:

- **Outbox** — domain events are written atomically with the order state change in the same DB transaction, then dispatched by a background worker to WMS/TMS/POS/GW.
- **Webhooks** — external systems POST callbacks to OMS inbound webhook endpoints. All webhook endpoints return `202 Accepted` immediately. Each handler stages an `OrderWebhookLog` entry atomically with the domain state change.

## 2. Order State Machine

### 2.1 Standard Flow (Post-Paid / Delivery)

```
Pending → BookingConfirmed → PickStarted → PickConfirmed → Packed → OutForDelivery → Delivered → Invoiced → Paid
```

| Transition | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Pending` (initial) | `POST /orders` | |
| `BookingConfirmed` | WMS webhook: `/webhooks/wms/booking-confirmed` | |
| `PickStarted` | WMS webhook: `/webhooks/wms/pick-started` | |
| `WaveStarted` | WMS webhook: `/webhooks/wms/wave-started` | Internal event only — not a persisted status column. Valid only when order is in `PickStarted`. Triggers `WaveStartedSentToGW` outbox event. Duplicate wave events are idempotent. |
| `PickConfirmed` | WMS webhook: `/webhooks/wms/pick-confirmed` | |
| `Packed` | WMS webhook: `/webhooks/wms/packed` | |
| `OutForDelivery` | TMS webhook: `/webhooks/tms/package-dispatched` | |
| `Delivered` | TMS webhook: `/webhooks/tms/package-delivered` | |
| `Invoiced` | POS webhook: `/webhooks/pos/invoiced` | |
| `Paid` | POS webhook: `/webhooks/pos/payment-confirmed` | |

### 2.2 Prepaid Flow (Delivery — Slot Pre-Booked via TMS)

The prepaid flow differs from post-paid in three key ways:

1. **No BookingConfirmed step** — the delivery slot is booked directly via TMS before the sale order is created. OMS transitions from `Pending` directly to `PickStarted`.
2. **ABB/Tax Invoice issued after PickConfirmed** — STS sends the official ABB/Tax Invoice to SC after `PickConfirmed`, which SC forwards to WMS and GW before TMS dispatches.
3. **Optional Credit Note** — STS may issue a credit note after `PickConfirmed`. SC receives the webhook, stores the credit note, and forwards it to WMS and GW via outbox.

**Prepaid sequence:**

```
[Customer → GW → PS → TMS]   TimeSlotRequested (query available windows before order)
[Customer → GW → PS → TMS]   BookingCreated (slot locked)
[Customer → GW → PS → SC]    OrderCreated → Pending
SC → WMS                      SaleOrderSentToWMS (outbox)
SC → TMS                      SaleOrderSentToTMS (outbox)
WMS → SC                      PickStarted (webhook: /webhooks/wms/pick-started)
WMS → SC                      WaveStarted (webhook)
SC → GW                       WaveStartedSentToGW (outbox)
[WMS → SC → POS]              POS Recalculation loop — OMS calls POS API (outbound); repeats as needed
WMS → SC                      PickConfirmed (webhook: /webhooks/wms/pick-confirmed)
SC → TMS                      PickConfirmedSentToTMS (outbox)
SC → GW                       PickConfirmedSentToGW (outbox)
                               ↑ GW receives PickConfirmed → GW processes payment externally → STS notifies OMS
STS → SC                      ABBTaxInvoiceReceived (webhook) or CreditNoteReceived (webhook)
SC → WMS                      ABBInvoiceSentToWMS (outbox)
SC → GW                       ABBInvoiceSentToGW (outbox)
[Optional] SC → WMS           CreditNoteSentToWMS (outbox)
[Optional] SC → GW            CreditNoteSentToGW (outbox)
TMS → SC                      PackageDispatched (webhook: /webhooks/tms/package-dispatched) → OutForDelivery
SC → GW                       OutForDeliverySentToGW (outbox)
TMS → SC                      PackageDelivered (webhook: /webhooks/tms/package-delivered) → Delivered
SC → GW                       DeliveredSentToGW (outbox)
```

### 2.3 POD Flow (Pay on Delivery)

In the POD flow the customer pays at the point of delivery — cash or card. No advance invoice is issued before dispatch. STS issues the official ABB/Tax Invoice only after delivery is confirmed, and OMS forwards it to TMS and GW (not WMS, unlike Prepaid).

**POD sequence:**

| Step | Actor(s) | Event / Action |
|---|---|---|
| Slot query | Customer → GW → PS → TMS | TimeSlotRequested — available delivery windows queried |
| Slot locked | Customer → GW → PS → TMS | BookingCreated — delivery slot locked in TMS |
| Order created | Customer → GW → PS → SC | SaleOrder submitted; OMS creates order → `Pending` |
| Outbox to WMS | SC → WMS | `SaleOrderSentToWMS` outbox event |
| Outbox to TMS | SC → TMS | `SaleOrderSentToTMS` outbox event |
| Pick started | WMS → SC | `PickStarted` webhook: `/webhooks/wms/pick-started`; order → `PickStarted` |
| Wave started | WMS → SC | `WaveStarted` webhook |
| Outbox to GW | SC → GW | `WaveStartedSentToGW` outbox event |
| POS recalc loop | WMS → SC → POS | OMS calls POS API (outbound) synchronously; repeats as needed before `PickConfirmed` |
| Pick confirmed | WMS → SC | `PickConfirmed` webhook: `/webhooks/wms/pick-confirmed`; records basket qty; partial pick supported |
| Outbox to TMS | SC → TMS | `PickConfirmedSentToTMS` outbox event (basket qty) |
| Outbox to GW | SC → GW | `PickConfirmedSentToGW` outbox event |
| *(external)* | GW → external | GW receives `Delivered` status, handles COD/payment collection outside OMS |
| Dispatched | TMS → SC | `PackageDispatched` webhook: `/webhooks/tms/package-dispatched`; order → `OutForDelivery` |
| Outbox to GW | SC → GW | `OutForDeliverySentToGW` outbox event |
| Pre-delivery recalc | TMS → SC | `RecalculationRequested` webhook: `/webhooks/tms/recalculation-requested`; OMS calls POS for final recalc; records `RecalcRequested` event in timeline |
| Delivered | TMS → SC | `PackageDelivered` webhook: `/webhooks/tms/package-delivered`; order → `Delivered` |
| Outbox to GW | SC → GW | `DeliveredSentToGW` outbox event |
| *(external)* | GW → external → STS | GW receives `Delivered` status, processes externally; STS then sends invoice/credit note to OMS |
| ABB/Tax Invoice | STS → SC | `ABBTaxInvoiceReceived` webhook — issued after `Delivered` in POD |
| Outbox to TMS | SC → TMS | `ABBTaxInvoiceSentToTMS` outbox event (link to ABB/Tax Invoice) |
| Outbox to GW | SC → GW | `ABBTaxInvoiceSentToGW` outbox event (link to ABB/Tax Invoice) |
| Credit Note (optional) | STS → SC | `CreditNoteReceived` webhook — only if credit note exists |
| Outbox to TMS (optional) | SC → TMS | `CreditNoteSentToTMS` outbox event |
| Outbox to GW (optional) | SC → GW | `CreditNoteSentToGW` outbox event |

**Key behavioral differences vs. Prepaid:**

| Aspect | Prepaid | POD |
|---|---|---|
| WaveStarted step | Yes — WMS → SC → GW | Yes — WMS → SC → GW |
| Invoice timing | Before dispatch — STS issues ABB/Tax Invoice after `PickConfirmed` | After delivery — STS issues ABB/Tax Invoice after `Delivered` |
| ABB/Tax Invoice forwarded to | WMS + GW | TMS + GW |
| Credit Note forwarded to | WMS + GW | TMS + GW |

### 2.4 Click & Collect Flow

```
Pending → BookingConfirmed → PickStarted → PickConfirmed → ReadyForCollection → Collected → Invoiced → Paid
```

`ReadyForCollection` is triggered by POS webhook `/webhooks/pos/pos-collection-ready`.  
`Collected` is triggered by POS webhook `/webhooks/pos/collected`.

### 2.5 Special Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `OnHold` | Manual hold (supervisor) or automatic hold (damaged goods). `pre_hold_status` saves the previous status and is restored on release. |
| `Cancelled` | Allowed from `Pending`, `BookingConfirmed`, or `OnHold` only. Triggers `OrderCancelledEvent` → WMS reverses stock reservation. |
| `ReadyForCollection` | Click & Collect only — order packed and waiting at store counter. |
| `Collected` | Customer picked up the order at the store. |
| `Returned` | Full or partial return processed. |

| UC9 | Cancel Order | `PATCH /orders/{id}/cancel` | Allowed from `Pending`, `BookingConfirmed`, `OnHold` only |
| UC10 | Click & Collect Ready | POS webhook | Order ready at store; customer notified |
| UC11 | Collected | POS webhook | Customer collects; invoice triggered |
| UC12 | Invoiced | POS webhook | POS issues fiscal invoice; status → `Invoiced` |
| UC13 | Payment Confirmed | POS webhook | Payment received; status → `Paid` |
| UC14 | Return | `POST /returns` + WMS webhooks | ReturnRequested → PickupScheduled → PickedUp → Received → Inspected → PutAway → Refunded |
| UC15 | POS Recalculation | `POST /webhooks/wms/recalculation-requested` or `POST /orders/{id}/recalculate` | OMS calls POS API outbound synchronously; returns `adjustedAmount` immediately |
| UC16 | Order Detail & Timeline | `GET /orders/{id}`, `/timeline` | Full order detail with event history across domain/webhook/outbox |

| UC19 | Delivery Slot | `GET/PATCH /orders/{id}/delivery-slot` | View or reschedule slot; not allowed after OutForDelivery |
| UC20 | Package Damaged | TMS webhook | Driver reports damage; status → `OnHold`; goods returned to warehouse |
| UC21 | Purchase Order | `POST/GET /inbound/purchase-orders` + WMS webhooks | PO Created → FullyReceived → Closed |
| UC22 | Transfer Order | `POST/GET /inbound/transfer-orders` + WMS webhooks | Created → PickConfirmed → InTransit → Received → Completed |
| UC23 | Damaged Goods Receipt | WMS webhooks | Damaged return checked in; items inspected; order placed OnHold |
| UC24 | Stock Ledger | `GET /stock/{sku}/ledger` | Read-only per-SKU stock movement view |
| UC25 | Time Slot Request (Prepaid) | Customer → GW → PS → TMS | Available delivery windows queried before order creation |
| UC26 | Delivery Booking (Prepaid) | Customer → GW → PS → TMS | Slot booked before sale order; OMS skips BookingConfirmed |
| UC27 | POS Recalculation (Prepaid) | WMS → SC → POS (mid-pick) | Repeats multiple times during picking; not limited to substitutions |
| UC28 | Pre-Delivery Invoice (Prepaid) | SC → WMS/GW after PickConfirmed | ABB/Tax Invoice received from STS after PickConfirmed; forwarded to WMS and GW before TMS dispatch |
| UC29 | STS Tax Invoice Settlement | STS → SC → WMS/GW after PickConfirmed | Official ABB/Tax Invoice forwarded to WMS and GW; optionally followed by credit note to WMS and GW |
| UC-WAVE | WaveStarted | WMS webhook: `/webhooks/wms/wave-started` | WMS starts wave picking while order is in `PickStarted`; SC forwards notification to GW via `WaveStartedSentToGW` outbox event. Not a persisted status column. |
| UC-PARTPICK | Partial Pick | WMS webhook (pick-confirmed with partial quantities) | WMS picks fewer items than ordered (e.g. item out of stock or not fresh); OMS records partial quantities on order lines; remaining items are cancelled; POS recalc triggered. Partial pick cannot reduce all line quantities to zero — use Cancel Order instead. |
| UC-RESCHEDULE | Rescheduler | `PATCH /orders/{id}/delivery-slot` | Customer or operator reschedules delivery slot. Not allowed after `OutForDelivery`; returns `409 invalid_transition` if attempted. |
| UC-PARTRETURN | Partial Item Return with Refund | Customer rejects items at delivery | Customer receives order but rejects one or more items at delivery (e.g. item not fresh). Rejected items are returned; OMS triggers partial refund via POS/STS. Only allowed after `Delivered` status. Each returned line item must reference the original order line. |
| UC-CREDITNOTE | Credit Note from STS (Prepaid) | STS webhook: `CreditNoteReceived` | STS issues credit note after `PickConfirmed`; SC receives webhook, stores credit note, forwards to WMS via `CreditNoteSentToWMS` and to GW via `CreditNoteSentToGW` outbox events. Requires `X-Idempotency-Key`; duplicate events are ignored. |
| UC-POD-BRANCH | BranchNearMe (POD) | Customer → GW | Customer queries nearby branches via GW before booking a delivery slot. GW returns branch list from its own data source. No OMS involvement in this step. |
| UC-POD-PICKSTART | PickStarted (POD) | WMS webhook: `/webhooks/wms/pick-started` | WMS notifies OMS that picking has begun; OMS transitions order to `PickStarted`. |
| UC-POD-INVOICE | Post-Delivery Invoice (POD) | TMS webhook: `/webhooks/tms/package-delivered` | After order reaches `Delivered`, STS subsequently sends `ABBTaxInvoiceReceived` webhook; OMS forwards the invoice to TMS (`ABBTaxInvoiceSentToTMS`) and GW (`ABBTaxInvoiceSentToGW`). |
| UC-POD-CREDITNOTE | Credit Note (POD) | STS webhook: `CreditNoteReceived` | Optional STS credit note issued after delivery. OMS receives webhook and dispatches `CreditNoteSentToTMS` outbox event to TMS and `CreditNoteSentToGW` to Gateway. Requires `X-Idempotency-Key`; duplicates are ignored. |

## 4. Key Design Invariants

- **Monetary values** — stored as `decimal` in THB. Never use float for currency.
- **Timestamps** — ISO 8601 UTC (`timestamptz`) throughout. API responses use `Z` suffix.
- **Idempotency** — all inbound webhook handlers require `X-Idempotency-Key`. Duplicate keys are ignored and not reprocessed.
- **Outbox atomicity** — every domain event is written in the same DB transaction as the aggregate mutation. No event can be lost even if the background dispatcher crashes.
- **`pre_hold_status`** — must be saved before any `OnHold` transition and restored exactly on release. The `order_holds` log is append-only.
- **`substitution_flag`** — set to `true` when any substitution record is created; never reset.
- **Cancellation guard** — only allowed from `Pending`, `BookingConfirmed`, or `OnHold`. Returns `409 invalid_transition` otherwise.
- **Delivery slot update guard** — slot cannot be changed once the order is `OutForDelivery` or later.
- **Error envelope** — all error responses use `{ "error": "<code>", "detail": "<message>" }`.
- **Bearer JWT** — required on all endpoints; 1-hour expiry; obtained via `POST /auth/token`.
- **`source_order_id`** — the external system's reference; used for idempotent order creation.
- **WaveStarted gate** — the `WaveStarted` webhook is only valid when the order is in `PickStarted` status. Duplicate wave events are idempotent and do not re-trigger the outbox event.
- **Credit Note idempotency** — credit note webhooks from STS require `X-Idempotency-Key`. Duplicate credit note events are ignored and not reprocessed.
- **Partial Pick guard** — partial pick cannot reduce picked quantity to zero across all order lines. If all lines would reach zero, the order must be fully cancelled via Cancel Order instead.
- **Partial Return guard** — partial item return is only allowed after `Delivered` status. Each returned line item must reference the original order line ID.
- **STS routing** — ABB/Tax Invoice and Credit Note events from STS are routed based on payment method: for Prepaid, both WMS and GW receive the events; for POD, both TMS and GW receive the events. Routing is enforced via `config.outbox_routing_rules` rows keyed on `(trigger_event, payment_method)`.

---

## 5. Multi-BU and Multi-Channel Routing

The OMS supports multiple business units (BUs) and multiple channel types. Routing of outbox events is driven by the `config.outbox_routing_rules` table, keyed on `(channel_type, business_unit, trigger_event)`.

### Marketplace-Specific Routing

- **TikTok Marketplace**: At `PickConfirmed`, OMS must call TikTok's API (via `TmsAdapter` or dedicated `MarketplaceAdapter`) in addition to the standard outbox events.
- **Lazada Marketplace**: At `Packed` (PackConfirmed), OMS must send data to Lazada's API via the marketplace adapter.
- These are driven by `outbox_routing_rules` entries where `channel_type = 'Marketplace'` and `business_unit IN ('TikTok', 'Lazada')`.

### Gateway-Specific Routing

- **Gateway A**: Receives `WaveStartedSentToGW` outbox event (opted in via routing rule).
- **Gateway B**: Does NOT receive wave status updates (no routing rule entry for WaveStarted).
- This is controlled by presence or absence of an `outbox_routing_rules` row for the `WaveStartedSentToGW` trigger event per gateway business unit.

### Payment Method as a Routing Dimension

`paymentMethod` on the order is also a routing dimension evaluated by `config.outbox_routing_rules`. Specifically:

- `paymentMethod = 'POD'` — STS invoice events (`ABBTaxInvoiceReceived`, `CreditNoteReceived`) are routed to TMS and GW.
- `paymentMethod = 'Prepaid'` — STS invoice events are routed to WMS and GW.

This is enforced via `outbox_routing_rules` rows keyed on `(trigger_event, payment_method)`. No conditional logic in application code — routing is entirely table-driven.

### Business Unit Data Isolation

- Each BU (e.g., CMG, CFR) operates in strict isolation: an operator or system acting on behalf of CMG may only read and modify orders belonging to CMG.
- OMS enforces this at the application layer: every API request carries a `business_unit` claim in the Bearer JWT. The order query layer filters by `business_unit` and rejects cross-BU mutations with `403 forbidden_business_unit`.
- Example: CMG operators cannot view, cancel, or modify CFR orders, and vice versa.
